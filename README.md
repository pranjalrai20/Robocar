# Robocar
A bot that accepts command wirelessly from a device. This project was made using Arduino IDE, Arduino UNO microcontroller and HC-05 Bluetooth module.



# HC-05 Bluetooth Module
HC-05 is a Bluetooth module which can communicate in two way. Which means, It is full-duplex. We can use it with most micro controllers. Because it operates Serial Port Protocol (SSP).



# Technical Specifications
    Operating Voltage: 4V to 6V (Typically +5V)
    Operating Current: 30mA
    Range: <100m



# Connections Arduino UNO to HC-05
Rx to Tx

Tx to Rx

5v to +5v

GND to GND



# You can use any application, just be careful about the string sent to HC- 05 and string in the condition statement.
